# BoXFP
 **Tool box for analysis of capillary electrophoresis footprinting data**

 ## What is BoXFP?

 BoxFP is a platform independent software package designed for quick, efficient and reliable analysis of capillary electrophoresis data of footprinted nucleic acid samples. 

## What can BoXFP do? 

BoXFP has been developed as a series of add on packages to the QuShape Software package developed by Dr Fethullah Karabiber of the Weeks Laboratory. It utilises a number of algorithms to effectively provide nucleotide specific reactivity information from both single experiments and  over several replicates. Capillary electrophoresis data from SHAPE, Hydroxyl-radical and enzyme based reactivity probing experiments can all be analysed using the package.
